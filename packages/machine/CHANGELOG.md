## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- **`State.toGraph(state, tapeBlock)`** static — walks the reachable graph from a state and returns a serializable `Graph` (states, transitions, alphabets).
- **`State.fromGraph(graph)`** static — inverse of `toGraph`; rebuilds `State` instances + a fresh `TapeBlock` from a `Graph`. Round-trips losslessly via `toMermaid` / `fromMermaid`.
- **`State.inspect(state)`** static — single-state introspection (id, name, isHalt, override-halt target, transitions) without graph traversal or a tapeBlock.
- **`toMermaid(graph)`** — renders a `Graph` to Mermaid flowchart syntax.
- **`fromMermaid(text)`** — parses Mermaid produced by `toMermaid` back into a `Graph`.
- **`summarize(state, tapeBlock)`** / **`summarizeGraph(graph)`** — quantitative analysis of a state graph (state count, transition count, composition depth, cycles, alphabet sizes). Useful for comparing two implementations of the same algorithm.
- **`equivalentOn(reference, candidate, cases, options?)`** — behavioral equivalence checking. Runs both machines on test cases and reports agreement, first-divergence step, and per-side step counts. Supports same-alphabet and (with custom comparator) cross-alphabet comparison.
- New type exports: `Graph`, `GraphNode`, `GraphTransition`, `GraphCommand`, `GraphSummary`, `Runnable`, `EquivalenceCase`, `EquivalenceResult`, `EquivalenceReport`.

### Changed

- TypeScript `target` and `module` raised from `ES6` to `ES2020` (consumers see compiled `dist/` only — no observable difference).

### Removed

- **BREAKING** — the `./src` subpath in `package.json` `exports` was removed. Consumers using `import { ... } from '@turing-machine-js/machine/src'` must drop the `/src` suffix and use `import { ... } from '@turing-machine-js/machine'`.

### Migration

```diff
- import { ... } from '@turing-machine-js/machine/src';
+ import { ... } from '@turing-machine-js/machine';
```

The `/src` subpath was an in-monorepo dev-time shim that never had a real reason to be on the npm tarball.

## [2.0.2] - earlier

Initial public 2.x release.
